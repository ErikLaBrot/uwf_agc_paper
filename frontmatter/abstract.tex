\chapter*{Abstract}

This report details the development of an autonomous driving system implemented on a modified utility golf cart.
The system described implements both low level and high level control, realized by a Texas Instruments c2000 series
microcontroller, and a Jetson edge computing device. The low level controller interfaces with the golf cart that has been modified 
in a drive-by-wire style to allow for automated control of steering, throttle, and brake. Likewise, the high level controller
interfaces with the c2000 by providing it with velocity and steering angle setpoints, deriving these from a GPS based
waypoint follower.

To support controller design, a planar vehicle model is derived that encompasses the longitudinal dynamics and lateral kinematics. This
model forms the basis for the controller and simulation design. The simulation is used for controller tuning and algorithm verification before
deployment to the physical golfcart.
