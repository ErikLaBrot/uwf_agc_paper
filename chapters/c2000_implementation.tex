\chapter{Low Level Control Implementation}
[Discuss controller implemenation on C2000 leveraging TI hardware and Matlab tools]
As mentioned in previous chapters, the platform was upgraded to a Texas Instruments C2000 based microcontroller.
Specifically, the TI F28379D LaunchpadXL. The hardware peripherals this microcontroller provides are capable of replacing 
the original multiple microcontroller design with overhead for later extension. 

Additionally, its integration with software tools like MATLAB and Simulink is leveraged to simplify controller implementation, 
as well as increase transparency and enable an enhanced level of documentation.
