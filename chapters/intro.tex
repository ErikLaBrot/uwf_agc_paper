\chapter{Introduction}
This project contributes to the progress of the University of West Florida 
autonomous golf cart project. The golf cart project focuses on enabling a small-scale
platform with intelligent capabilities such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Ultimately,
this will provide the platform as a component to a ride-share style service with the 
stated goal of calling the cart from across the University campus.

\section{Motivation and Project Goals}
The motivation of this particular stage of the project is to design a new control system layered
atop the existing platform to bring it to a higher level of autonomy. This new control system will 
leverage the capabilities of newer, more powerful computational hardware and software to improve 
upon the original system. The ultimate goal of this stage of the project is to have a platform that is capable
of autonomous navigation between GPS waypoints, flowing desired motion down to a new low-level controller capable 
of commanding velocity and steering.

\section{Project Scope and Constraints}
[Discuss what is and is not included in the project]
The scope of this project stage is to modify the hardware of the golf cart, such as microcontrollers and sensors,
to produce an autonomous platform. Additionally, simulation work will be performed as supplementary verification of 
design. 
\section{Contributions}
The contributions of this stage of the project are as follows;
- Platform Rewire
- Low Level Speed Controller 
- High Level Position Controller
